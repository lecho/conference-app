With more platforms coming out, there's a clear need of bundling logic that can be reused and shared in multiple platforms. Frameworks will help us with that and will benefit our application code bases in many ways. Learn how to do it, with or without dependency manager involved, recommendations and some caveats you must keep in mind. Start building your own Foundation frameworks, reusable, well designed, and with single responsibilities.",
